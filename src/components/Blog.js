              Vintage collectibles are in demand right now for a variety of
              reasons, and the interest in vintage items goes well beyond just
              those who consider themselves collectors. Many non-collectors have
              shown an interest in buying vintage as well, and nostalgia is one
              of the driving forces behind this trend, leading to popularity
              with both the older and younger generations. As millennials age,
              items from their childhood are edging ever closer to the “vintage”
              category, creating demand for those items. Gen Z is even getting
              in on the action, with an interest in vintage clothing styles and
              thrift shopping.

              Every photographer experiences gear envy at some point or another.
              Especially if you spend any amount of time on social media looking
              at a bunch of photographers’ setups. However, one of the most
              important tips to become a better photographer is to remember is
              that you don’t need a bunch of fancy gear.

            <p>
              Autobiographical memory is a complex blend of memories of single,
              recurring, and extended events that are integrated into a coherent
              story of self that is created and evaluated via sociocultural
              practices. Autobiographical memory is distinct from episodic
              memory in that (a) it relies on a sense of self that emerges
              around the end of the preschool years; (b) it is formed through
              engagement with the world and others and involves multiple
              developing skills for constructing coherent stories that
              contribute to a person’s sense of identity based on their history;
              and (c) has the sociocultural function of defining and regulating
              a person’s emotions (Robyn Fivush and Matthew E. Graci). In short,
              autobiographical memory pertains to the stories we tell about
              ourselves and our lives.

              I have a confession: I was not (and am not) always a rocker. If
              you read my articles on the best live albums of the 70s or the
              albums that got me through my Army days you might find this
              surprising, but I assure you it’s true. As proof, I give you four
              so-called soft rock albums from the 1970s that I played
              repeatedly, sometimes immediately after blasting KISS or Boston. I
              say so-called soft rock, because there is much debate about what
              belongs in this category, or if the category should exist at all.
              It could be argued that the greatest soft rock album of all time
              is Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours, but then what of songs like “Go Your
              Own Way” “Second Hand News,” or “The Chain?” In the end, Rumours
              remains above classification.

              True story: A print reporter once said to me “Well, yeah, all that
              recording you have to do for radio, that’s hard I suppose. But, at
              least you don’t have to write!” I tried to set him straight. From
              story focus to choosing quotes to narration to editing scripts….
              It’s all about writing. So, not only do we have the technical
              aspects of our work, we have to write, too. He wouldn’t have it.
              He thought radio producers were just good talkers. I gave up.
              Given how much writing is involved in producing radio stories, I’m
              surprised I haven’t focused on it more frequently. I need to
              change that – not only for radio producers looking for writing
              tips but for print reporters with the wrong impression. On this
              episode, writing out of tape: transitioning from a quote to
              narration. Usually, a narrator will move to a new idea when they
              come out of a quote. In fact, it’s almost like the narrator
              ignores what was just said and simply keeps moving forward.
              Reporter Mose Buchele recently did the opposite. For some of his
              narration in a story he produced for NPR, Mose used quotes to
              propel him forward into the next idea and to change scenes. It’s
              an uncommon approach and one worth considering for your next
              story.

              See the bulbous areas in the black and blue pins? Those increase
              the friction the pin has with the beam, making it more difficult
              to spin freely. The light bley and tan pins spin very easily; the
              black and blue ones don't.I knew this about the Grey and Black
              pins being different for friction, but I did not know this about
              the Blue and Tan. I remember they used to make a light grey
              version of that new Tan piece (I have a ton of them), but it looks
              like Tan is the new standard for that piece? And I didn't realize
              the blue one added friction. TIL, too!

              It’s best to keep carriages on typewriters unless absolutely
              necessary since it’s easy to lose pieces or damage parts on
              removal. However, since this one came to me with the carriage off,
              it did make cleaning the frozen parts easier. I started working
              and thinking. Over the course of the last few weeks, real life
              would interfere with the work, but I kept the gears quietly
              turning in the back of my mind. Sometimes I would wake up in the
              morning after a night of Royal 10 dreams with new insights and
              solutions to its issues. Typewriter repair is a meditative and
              creative activity for me, full of surprise and revelation. The
              thought processes are much like those a painter uses when engaged
              with a piece.

              Retro photo camera and vintage telephone but I kept the gears
              quietly turning in the back of my mind. Sometimes I would wake up
              in the morning after a night of Royal 10 dreams with new insights
              and solutions to its issues. Typewriter repair is a meditative and
              creative activity for me, full of surprise and revelation. The
              thought processes are much like those a painter uses when engaged
              with a piece.

              Composition of marmalade and instant photo.
            </h2>
            <p>
              Love marmalade? Here’s a fast and easy way to make just about any
              amount of marmalade with whatever citrus fruit – or combination of
              citrus fruits – you desire. I used sour Seville oranges for a
              classic orange marmalade for this batch and then used pink
              grapefruit for a second batch. I’ve streamlined the technique from
              this recipe to simplify and speed up the process without
              compromising on flavor. Note: This is more of a general technique
              than an exact recipe with very specific quantities, so feel free
              to adjust it for the amount of fruit you have. A very loose rule
              of thumb is to have one cup of sugar available per piece of fruit.
              You may not use all of it, but you have the ability to decide how
              tart or sweet your batch will be. While I’m writing this recipe
              for oranges, keep in mind you can use grapefruit, too. I’ve even
              heard of using oranges, grapefruit and lemons together!

              Marmalade worms. gelatinous worms, multi-colored intertwined in
              the shape of a heart lavor. Note: This is more of a general
